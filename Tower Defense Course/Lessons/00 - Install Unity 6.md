Before you can start this course, you will need to ensure you have the correct version of Unity installed. In this course, you will be using Unity 6 (version: 6000.0.XYZ), although many aspects of this project will likely work in later versions, no guarantees will be made by the author.

## Installing Unity 6000.0.XYZ

- [ ] In **Unity Hub** select the **Installs** tab on the left side of the interface. Then select **Install Editor**.

- [ ] Under **Official releases** locate the **Unity 6** section and select a version that starts with **6000.0**. **Note**: Anything that comes after **6000.0.** is called a patch number and for our purposes we want to ensure that it ends with the letter `f`

- [ ] Before clicking finalizing the **Install** be sure you add the **WebGL Build Support** module on the next screen. You will need to scroll through the available modules to find it. You do not need any other modules for this project.

If all went well, the **Editor application** and **WebGL  Build Support** module will download and install. Depending on your internet connection speed and your computer's processor speed, this can take anywhere from 5 minutes to 1 hour to complete (longer for slower internet connections).

**Note**: After the download has finished, the installer will prompt you to finish the installation. You may need the password you use to log into your computer to finish this step. If you encounter any issues, do not hesitate to contact your instructor.

After the install is complete, you should see an **Install complete** message and a green check mark next to **Editor application** and **WebGL Build Support**. If you do not see this, contact your instructor for additional help.
