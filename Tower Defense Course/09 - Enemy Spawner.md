In this section, you will implement an **Enemy Spawner** that repeatedly spawns new Enemies for your player to destroy!

### Challenge: Enemy Spawner Prefab

Before implementing the **Enemy Spawner** script, create a **Prefab** that can be placed on your map where **Enemies** will spawn. Then, place one in your world at the start of your path.

When you're finished, it will look similar to the image below. **Note**: You can hide your **Waypoint**s from being viewed in the **Scene View** by clicking the **Eye Icon** in the **Hierarchy** next to the parent container.
